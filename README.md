## ‚ö° Usage

### Single Link Mode

Run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```

- Paste your video page link when prompted.
- Wait for extraction (progress bar will show).
- Links are shown in the terminal and saved to `video_links.html`.
- You will be asked if you want to host the file on `localhost` for easy clicking/downloading.

---

### Batch Mode

- Create a file called `urls.txt` (or any other name you prefer).
- Add one video page URL per line.
- Run the script and choose batch mode (`2`) when prompted.
- The script will process each link, extract video links, and group them by video title in `video_links.html`.

#### Example `urls.txt`

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxx
https://vimeo.com/xxxxxxx
https://somesite.com/xxxxxxx
```

## üåê Viewing & Using Your Download Links

- After extraction, if you choose to host, the script starts a local web server (default port 8000+).
- You‚Äôll get a link like `http://localhost:8000/video_links.html`.
- Open this in any browser (desktop, mobile, or any device on your network).
- Click the links to download the files directly.

---

## üì± The HTML Output

- The HTML page is **responsive** and works on all devices.
- Each video section is grouped by its title.
- Only columns shown: Number, Resolution, Size, and a clickable file name (not the raw URL).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

- Handles invalid URLs, missing yt-dlp, missing dependencies, network errors, permission errors, and port conflicts.
- Attempts fallback extraction if yt-dlp can't extract formats.
- Prompts for authentication details/cookies if needed.
